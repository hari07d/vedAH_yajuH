      <description>SOME ASPECTS OF THE AGNI-MYTHOLOGY IN THE VEDA
The subject of my lectures! is “Some Aspects of the Agol. Mythology in the Veda &amp;quot; Accordingly, my aim, in these lectures, will not be to present any detailed and connected statement about the Agar mythology as a whole, I shall only endeavour to emphasize certain points relating to Agni as he figures in the Vedic mythology and ritual - points, which, I think, do not usually receive sufficient attention of course, while doing so, I shall have to presume, on the part of my listeners, a general acquain tance with the broad outlines of the Agni-mythology It is well known that Agni is, Dext to Indra, the most promi.</description>

      <description>ASURA VARUNA
Paradoxical as it may seem, one will all the same be justified in saying that the Vedic researches have been the earliest and the richest among the indological researches and still the unsolved Vedic problems are the greatest in number among the indologi cal problems Particularly the field of Vedic mythology cannot be said even now to have been fully and satisfactorily exploited Varuṇa, for example is the most august and greatly elevated divinity in the pantheon of Vedic gods and still his essential character remains enigmatic This paradox may appear to be still more striking!</description>

      <description>APPENDIX
INDO EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY - SOME NOTES
(1) Comparative mythology is a natural extension of com parative linguistics A comparative study of the various laoguages of the wide region extending from Ireland in the west to India jo the east led to the assumption first of a common Indo-European (IE) language as the ancient ancestor of all those languages, and subsequently of a common IE people, who spoke that language, and of a common IE culture, particularly of common IE scugion and mythology Understandably enough, the study of Vedic language and Vedic religion and mythology served almost as the starting point of the two disciplines of comparative lingule stics and comparative mythology However, in the early years of the history of Vedic philology in the West, scholars like BOPP, BOHLEN, and BENFEY are seen to have evinced greater interest in the language of the Veda than in the religion and my thology of the Veda, though we do come across such stray speculations relating to comparative mythology as that Sāra meyau in the Rgieda are identical with Greek Kerberos, that Dionysos is to be understood as the joint divinity of dyu (day) and miś (night) (both these suggestions by BENFEY), and that the legend of the Panis and the cows is comparable to the myth of Cacus ard Evander (suggested by F ROSEN) Exen ROTH, who may be said to have inaugurated the era of critical Vedic scholarship with his worth 2x Litteratus wd Geschichte des Weda (1846), did not occupy lumself to any appreciable extent 1 Thesc notes were prepared for a paper which I was invited to present at the Indo Soviet Symposium on &amp;quot; Ethnic problems of the early bistory of the peoples of Central Asia and lacia in the second millennium BC, held at Dushanbe, USSR, on October 17 22, 1977 It was intended that these potes would be developed into a full rescarch paper after the reaction to them of the participants in the Symposuim had become known Unfortunately, however, for personal reasons, I could not attend the Symposium at Dushanbe 352 VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS with comparative mythology as such It is Adalbert KUHN who must be regarded as the true pioneer of comparative mythology with special reference to the Veda KUHN believed that, just as the JE peoples derived their respective languages from a common IE language, they also derived most of their mythological concepts from a common IE mythology He further believed that the etymologies of the names of the various Vedic gods provided ample material for identifying the IE elements in Vedic mythology In other words comparative linguistics and comparative mytho logy went hand in hand And, thirdly, he believed that most of the Vedic (and, therefore, IE) gods were personifications of natural powers and phenomena MAX MULLER also was an ardent exponent of this very kind of comparative mythology and based his theories about Vedic mythology on the three assumptions set forth by KUHN For instance, MAX MULLER accepted the equations Sārameyau = Hermeias, Saramā = Helena, Saranyu = Erionys, Parjanya=Perkunas (Lith), Usas=Eos, Bhaga=Bogu (old Slav ), Väta = Wotan, Vak = Vox, etc In bis Gifford Lectures on Anthropologica) Religion delivered at the University of Glasgow in 1891, MAX MULLER uttered these momentous words &amp;ldquo;If I were asked what I consider the most important dis covery which has been made during the nineteenth century with respect to the ancient history of mankind, I should say it was the simple etymological equation Sanskrit Dyaus-Pitar = Greek Zeus Pater = Latin Jupiter = Old Norse Tyr&amp;rdquo; One can hardly think of a more eloquent simultaneous glorification of the two disciplines of comparative linguistics and comparative mytho logy The nineteenth century witnessed the rise of several academic disciplines (including archaeology ), but the major contribution of that century must, indeed, be regarded as having been the con cept of an IE language family (Incidentally, it was Thomas YOUNG who, in 1813, introduced the term &amp;ldquo;IE: while reviewing Johano ADELUNG&amp;rsquo;s work Mithridates ) The view has, no doubt, been expressed from time to time, by linguisticians like TRUBETZKOY, SOLTA, PISANI, and ALLEN, that the assumption INDO-EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY 353 of a single unitary Ur IE is by no means necessary for explaining the IE language family But, as THIEME has rightly pointed out, the IE languages have too many similarities to be explained by anything other than a common genetic origin Language is regarded as the most potent source for the study of a culture Language, according to KEARY, “holds within it far better than do tumuli or weapons, or articles of pottery or woven stuffs or ornaments, the records of long past times” CHILDE confirms this by stating that “language, albeit an abs traction, is yet a more subtle and pervasive criterion of indivi duality than the culture-group formed by comparing flints and potsherds of the &amp;lsquo;races&amp;rsquo; of skull measures &amp;quot; This view clearly smacks of a partiality for the study of language as against archaeology The obvious limitations of linguistics must not be lost sight of (2) A kind of reaction against the approach to Vedic mythology exclusively from the point of view of comparative mythology was but to be expected John MUIR, for instance, in the fifth volume of his Original Sanskrit Texts (1872), seemed to insist on Vedic religion and mythology being studied primarily from the Vedic sources, the comparative methods being utilised, if at all, only secondarily Abel BERGAIGNE also was generally averse to the methods of comparative mythology which had been so much overworked by KUHN and MAX MULLER The my thology of the Vedic Aryans was, according to him, closely con nected with their peculiar sacrificial cult which showed hardly any TE influence HILLEBRANDT also firmly believed that Vedic mythology and Vedic ritual were essentially inseparable He fur ther insisted that etymology, even if correct (and one could not be too sure of its correctness&#39;), was mythologically useless be cause the meaning which it furnished was so general that it rarely gave any sure clue to the character of a Vcdic god Similarly, though OLDENBERG had no objection to individual Vedic gods being traced back to tbeir IE forms, he rightly cautioned that in that connection one must free opeself from the realm of mere 45 354 VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS etymology According to OLDENBERG, Vedic religion must be viewed essentially and primarily as an Indian religion and not as a mere modification of IE religion He also emphasised the anthropological and ethnological factors in the development of Vedic religion and mythology (3) Though MACDONELL, BLOOMFIELD, and VON SCHR OEDER sought to revive the methods of comparative mythology in the study of Vedic religion and mythology, it came to be strongly reasserted (for instance, by PISCHEL and GELDNER ) that the Rgveda was predominantly an Indian document, that comparative linguistics was not necessarily a safe guide, and that the gulf between the earliest culture of the IE peoples of Europe and that of the Vedic age was such that no amount of phonetic equations could bridge it The unwarranted emphasis on the JE elements ia Vedic religion and mythology and the method of mere etymologising had consequently to be given up There also be came evident a growing tendency against the naturalistic inter pretation of Vedic mythology Among other tendencies which became prominent besides anti naturalism may be mentioned the awareness of the prevalence in Vedic religion of what might be called the ideology of primitive magic and the recognition of the non Aryan (non IE) elements 10 Vedic mythologyINDO-EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY 355 (a) The Vienna scholars like KOPPERS aver that the IE problem is not just a problem of linguistics and archaeology but that it is also a problem of ethnology and religion history The religious patterns develop in conformity with the levels of culture For instance, following W SCHMIDT, KOPPERS suggested that, while cattle served as the economic basis of the ProIO IE people with their home in the Central Asian Steppes, the horse as a sacrificial animal was more estcemed (b) M ELIADE bas attempted a typological analysis based on the concept of archetypes coined by C G JUNG and applied to religious studies by Karl KARENYI and Erich NEUMANN (c) E BENVENISTE has sought to endow the methods of comparative linguistics with new precision and to apply them to the yocabulary of institutions in an attempt to lay bare the primary notions underlying those institutions In this way, new light is believed to have been throgn on the foundations of many sostitutions of the modern world in the fields of social structure and relations, economics law, and religion (d) Soviet scholars have emphasized the definite proximity between Indo Iranian (specially Iranian) and Slavonic vocabu lary for social and religious concepts TOPOROV has, for instance, drawn attention to what he calls Slavonic reminiscences of the Mithrac terminology and to the demon adversaries of Indra and their correspondences jo a Russian folk tale (Vyamsa Usnya ) TOPOROV and IVANOV have analysed the Indra and the Parjanya hymns in the Rgveda with a view to the reconstruction of the IE mythologeme of the storm god and his adversary They have pointed to the correspondence betreen Vedic Vetra Vala and the Slavonic god Veles (Incidentally, R JACOBSON believes that Veles is clearly related to Varuṇa both linguistically and mytho logically ) ELIZARENKOVA and TOPOROV have attempted a semiotic interpretation of Indra&amp;rsquo;s prominence in the Rgvedic pan theon and of its pre history TOPOROV has investigated the gods as they are enumerated in The Russian Primary Chronicle, in the Igor Tale and in various other works with special reference to the Ancient Slavonic pantheon (and not to cukemerization) and has 354 VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS etymology According to OLDENBERG, Vedic religion must be viewed essentially and primarily as an Indian religion and not as a mere modification of IE religion He also emphasised the anthropological and ethnological factors in the development of Vedic religion and mythology (3) Though MACDONELL,

naturalism may be mentioned the awareness of the prevalence in Vedic religion of what might be called the ideology of primitive magic and the recognition of the non Aryan (non IE) elements 10 Vedic mythology (4) Such was the state of things when, nearly forty years ago, the discipline of comparative IE mythology was revived, but on different lines It has been pointed out that, instead of carry ing out minute historical research on the detailed development of the individual deities by forging links on the basis of sheer ety mological speculations and thereby patching up a ragged image composed of aimless bits of evidence, the new trends focussed attention on pattern and structure In other words, mythology was now studied in a structuralist way rather than in an &amp;lsquo;ato mistic&amp;rsquo; way The emphasis had shifted from lexical analogues 10 structural similarities The following principal approaches may be mentioned as representing these new trends in comparative IE mythology INDO-EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY 355 (a) The Vienna scholars like KOPPERS aver that the IE problem is not just a problem of linguistics and archaeology but that it is also a problem of

      <description>PÜSAN, THE PASTORAL GOD OF THE VEDA
Vedic gods often seem to possess very complex characters The descriptions in the Vedic hymns usually bring forth so many different traits of a single god that it is not always easy to deter mine the original nature and trace the later development of his personality In this respect Pusao may be regarded as being a particularly curious and enigmatic figure in the pantheon of Vedic gods This god is celebrated alone in ciglit hymns of the Rgveda, with Indra in one hymn, with Soma in one, and is mentioned with several other deities in about fifty eight hymns, his name thus being mentioned about 120 times He is also glorified in the Atharvaveda and the Bralimanas, and seems to have played a distinctive role in the Vedic ritual The picture of Pusan derived from all these manifold literary and ritual references is, indeed, puzzlingly composite Even a casual glance at the statistical analysis of the RV references to Pusan&#39; will suffice to bring out prominently a peculiar feature of the way in which this god has been celebrated in that Veda Out of the eight complete hymns glorifying Pusan, five occur in the sixth mandala of the RV which primarily reflects the literary and religious activities of the clan of the Bhāradvājas That portion of the sixth mandala (hymns 53-58, hymn 48 15-19), which is dedicated exclusively to Pusan, is so conspicuous that HILLEBRANDT chooses to call it a small Pusan-sambitā&amp;rsquo;in itself 2 This fact cannot be regarded as just an accident On the contrary it seems to indicate that the Pusan cult was a special possession of the family of the Bhāradvājas No discussion regarding the essential character of Pusan can be said to be complete and conclusive, unless the real significance of this impor Pusan 1 mentioned 36 times in the sixth mandala, while hic is referred 10 3 times in the second, 5 tubes in the third, 3 times in the fourth (at none of these places in the vocative ), 8 times in the filth, 6 times in the seventh, 6 times in the cighth, and more often in the first and the tenth mandalas, 2 Vedische Afythologie II, 330 VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS tant feature of the Puṣan religion in the RV is clearly explained Equally significant is the fact that the Panis are most prominently mentioned in the sixth mandala and that Pusan is the god who is specially invoked to put down those nasty mischief mongers of the Vedic times Another point that would strike a student of Vedic mythology is that Pusan is coupled rather predominantly only with two gods from the Vedic panicon, namely, Indra (VI 57) and Soma (II 40) A critical study of the passages referring to Indrā pusanau (11152 7, VI 57) leads one to the conclusion that originally the Indra religion and the Pusan religion were in independent religious cults and that a special effort was made to bring them together similar appears to have been the case also with regard to the coupling together of Soma and Puṣan The traces of this artificial blendıog together of two distinct religious cults are too clear in the RV to be missed The anthropomorphic traits in the descriptions of Pusan are also noteworthy Vedic re ferences to Pusan&amp;rsquo;s braided hair (VI 55 2 ) and beard (X 26 7), to his awl (VI 53 6 ) and goad (YI 53 9), to his special food, karambha (VI 56 1), to his car being driven by goats instead of horses (I 138 4, VI 55 3, 4, 57 3)- all these present before us quite a distinctive personality, that is to say, the personality of a god belonging to a world more or less different from that of many Vedic gods as we know them But by far the greatest emphasis is laid by the Vedic poets on the prominent role played by Pusan in the pastoral life of the people Indeed, Pusan is the only Vedic god who has been given the epithet paśupā, protector of the cattle (VI 58 2) durectly (and not in comparisons) He increases the cattle (VI 53 10, 54 5-6, 56 5) and brings back those that have strayed (VI 54 7, 10) He eats the food which is common among the pastoral communities (VI 56 1 ) and bears the goad (VL 53 9 ) which is typical of a shepherd as a cowherd It is said of him that he commands large amounts of wealth (1 89 6, VIII 4 15) and bestows great bounty (VI 584) On his worshippers, particularly in the form of the increase of cattle Another characteristic feature of Pusan&amp;rsquo;s personality is his close association with paths.</description>

      <description>RUDRA IN THE VEDA
It has been pointed out by me in another paperi that one of the very intriguing problems of Indian mythology pertains to the elevation of the god Viṣṇu from a more or less minor and obscure position which he occupies in Vedic mythology to the position of supreme preeminence in the later Hindu pantheon I have presented in that paper a complete picture of the various VICISSI tudes which occurred in the personality and character of that god from the point of view of what I have called evolutionary mythology, and have thereby offered a solution of that problem A similar problem can be posed in respect of another Vedic god, namely, Rudra It must be added, in this connection, that, as a matter of fact, the importance of the problem relating to Rudra is not limited only to the study of Indian religion and mythology For, in more senses than one, the Rudra problem touches several significant aspects of the entire cultural history of ancient India As a consequence of this, the Rudra problem naturally tends to become far more complex and comprehensive than the Visau problem A study of the Vedic literature as a whole brings out a very striking fact about the god Rudra It will appear, from that study, that there are, as it were, two distinct Rudras represented in that literature - one in the Rgieda (RV) and the other in the post-RV Vedic literature?</description>

      <description>NEW LIGHT ON THE VEDIC GOD, SAVITR
There has been considerable difference of opinion, among Vedic scholars, in respect of the exact interpretation of the character and personality of the Vedic god, Savitr. This fact naturally enbances our interest in the study of the Vedic mythology concerning that god A critical approach to the problem regarding the essential nature of Savitr is expected greatly to clanfy our views in the matter of Indo-European (IE ) mytho logy in general and Vedic mythology in particular.</description>

      <description>A VEDIC GOD AND A VEDIC SEER1
Varuṇa Lecture One “ VEDIC GOD VARUNA &amp;quot;
(Let me at the outset pay my tribute of piety and friendship to the reverently cherished memory of Professor VISHVA BANDHU, who, through his selfless and dedicated service extend. ing over half a century has done more than any other person 10 recent times for the promotion of Vedic studies and research We are all quite familiar with the various aspects of his magisterial work, and to dilate upon them on this occasion wovid be like the proverbial painting of the lily, guilding of refined gold, and adding of perfume to the violet VISHVA BANDHUJI was one of those rare personalities who built their own monuments during their life time We do not need to erect any fanciful memorial for VISHVA BANDHU, all that we have to do is solemnly to pledge oursclves to the task of ensuring that the activities of the great Institute for which he lived and died—the Vishveshvarananda Vedic Research Institute-progress uphampered, solidly and fruitfully Nearly twenty years ago, while Professor VISHVA BANDHU and I were serving on the Government of India&amp;rsquo;s Sanskrit Commission—he as a member and I as the Member Secretary we had several occasions to travel together VISHVA BANDHUJI then noticed that I was in the habit of occasionally humming verses from the Rgieda-and these, more or less exclusively drawn from the Varuṇa hymns of the seventh Mandala He asked me why those particular hymns enchanted me I replied that Varuṇa was the special god of the Vāsiṣṭhas and then added with a hint of mock seriousness, that I was a Vasistha (1 ani a Vasistha) Two Vishva Randhu Memorial I ectures delivered under the ausp cct of the Panjab University, at Chand gaib, on February 28 and March 1, 1975 VEDIC GOD: SARUNA 313 VISHVA BANDHU evinced great interest in that observation of min&#39;, which eventually came to be a topic of frequent friendly discussion Vhen I was invited to deliver there Vishra Bandhu Memoral Lectures, I thought that this would, indeed, be a proper theme for any discourse, namely, &amp;ldquo;A Vedic god (that is, Varuṇa) and a Vedic seer (that is, Vasistha)&amp;rdquo; I do not think that it is necessary to recount to an audicace such as this all that is said in the Raieda about Varuṇa I shall, honeser, say this much, namely, that any theory regarding the personality and character of Varuṇa, to be convincing, must fulfil two minimum conditions (1) it should take into account the basic and essential features of the Rgsedic Varuṇa, and (2) it should be possible, on the basis of that theory, to orginize those features into reasonably well structured religio-mythological pattern These basic and essential features are Varuṇa as the special guardian of rta, Varuṇa as Asura par excellence, Varuṇa&amp;rsquo;s letters, Varuṇa&amp;rsquo;s maja, Varuṇa&amp;rsquo;s unisersal sovereigoty, Yaruna&amp;rsquo;s intimate association with Mitra, and the rivalry between Varuda and Jadra Some years ago in a comprehcnsive paper on Asura Varuṇa,&amp;quot; I had critically examined various vcws about Varuṇa, such as, Varuṇa 25 the shy god (ROTII, SCHROEDER, BLOOMFIELD), Varuṇa as the god of night (JJ MEYER), Varuṇa (like Vr̥tra) as the restrainer of water (BERGAIGNE, JOHANSSON), Varuṇa as the chtlionic fertility god (JJ.</description>

      <description>VISNU IN THE VEDA
One of the most intriguing problems of Indian mythology relates to the elevation of Viṣṇu in the classical Hindu mythology to the prominent position of the supreme god from the more or less minor position which has been assigned to him in the Vedic mythology. He cannot be said to have ever been regarded, in the Vedic religion, as a god of any consequence. We do come across a few Vedic references to Viṣṇu (II 1 3,22 1, 34 11 ) which seem to reflect his glory, but actually they are quite general and pointless in character and by no means indicate that Viṣṇu ever dominated Vedic thought and faith, as for instance, Varuṇa and Indra did.</description>

      <description>VRTRAHA INDRA Vedic mythology, as we generally know it from the Rgreda (RV), is clearly dominated by the personality of Indra By far the largest number of suhtas - about 250 out of 1028 — are ex clusively devoted to the glorification of this god Apart from these suktas, there are several others, wherein Indra is praised in association with other gods or is referred to in some other connec tion Indra is thus obviously the most popular god of the Vedic pantheon He has always been regarded almost as the very sym bol of the official Vedic religion&amp;ndash;the Indra mythology being very nearly identified with the Vedic rcligion as a whole It is true that Indra is celebrated in nearly one fourth of the RV, but this fact must not be taken to indicate, as is usually done, that the Vedic religion had all along been dominated by the Indra my thology Such an assumption could only be the result of study ing the Vedic mythology as if it were a static phenomenon and would make it difficult rationally to correlate several mytho logical concepts in the Veda with the facts derived from the study of comparative philology, comparative mythology, anthropo logy, and the cultural history of the Aryans A critical study of the Veda would show that the Vedic mythology is essentially an cvolutionary mythology, that, at different stages in the cvolution of the Vedic mythological thought it has been domi nated by different Vedic gods, and that the Indra-dominated mythology represents but a lic stage in the course of that cyolu tion There is another aspec the Vedic mythology It will be seen that the personality of a Vedic god normally presents a cry complex picture it often contains ciements which are mutually inconsistent or sometimes cien self-contradictory Tlus peculiar inythological plicnomc.</description>

      <description>YAMA IN THE VEDA
Certain features of the Yama-mythology as represented in the Rgveda (RV) are apparently quite simple and uncomplicated This seeming simplicity itself has, however, misled many a scholar in the matter of the true interpretation of this mythology The picture of Yama - his personality and functions - as reconstructed from the RV references is characterised by considerable inconsis tency, discrepancy and vagueness An approach to this whole problem from the standpoint of evolutionary&#39; mythology will alone make it possible to restate the whole Yama-mythology as a reasonably homogeneous and consistent whole Let us first of all briefly recapitulate the several details of this mythology as given in the RV Only four complete hymns in the RV refer to Yama His name occurs about fifty times in the RV passages, which are almost exclusively to be found in the first and the tenth books of the RV Yama thus belongs, like Parjanya, to the fifth class or group of Vedic gods, on the basis of the frequency of the mention of his name This minor position held by Yama in the Vedic mythology indicates that the true nature of the personality of that god was already being tost sight of, the Vestiges of his original importance being revealed, as will be shown hereafter, only through stray references To begin with, a very significant fact about Yama is that he is never explicitly called a god&#39; in the RV He is no doubt mentioned in the company of other gods &amp;ndash; with Agni and Matarisyan among others (I 164 46), with Varuṇa (X 14 7) with Brhaspati (X 14 3) and with Agni among others (X 64 3,92 11) In X 51 1, we are told that a god found the hiding Agni, in X 51 3, we are told that it was Yama, who found Agoi thus indicating indirectly that Yama was a god At the same time, it is equally significant that Yama is never called a man&#39; As a matter of fact, he is clearly distin guished from the putrs (X 15 8), whose king and ford he is, though only once he is himself called pita (X 135 1) - obvi ously in a dufferent sense The mention of Yama and deid YAMA IN THE VEDA 119 Varuṇa, side by side (X 14 7), does not at all indicate that the poet wanted to distinguish between man Yama and god Varuṇa.</description>
