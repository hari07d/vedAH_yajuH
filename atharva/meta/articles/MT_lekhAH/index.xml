One who is in the grip of the vidyA-s of the dreaded dhUmAvatI and rakta-jyeShThA will be released from them by the secret formula known as the “bonds of the devI”. The one who goes beyond that step attains that ancient and most secret vidyA known as the prayoga of viliste~NgA. It was the secret of the atharvans of, that which arises from the herb which was known to bhR^igu and ushanA kAvya.</description>

Acquiring the atharvaveda either requires you to be born as a scion of the atharvan clan or acquire it through a separate upanayanam. The key to this new upanayanam is the need for the student to chant the sUktaM known as triShaptIyam (AV-S 1.1 or AV-P 1.6). Only by chanting the triShaptIyam does the power of the atharvanic mantras enter him so that he can use them. Thus the triShaptIyam is also used before commencing practice of atharvanic recitation or svAdhyAyaH.</description>

The only complete surviving oral tradition is that of the 4th veda is the shaunakIya(AV-S) recitation. Even this is dwindling now. The paippalAda recitation (AV-P) is not preserved with svaras. An ekashruti recitation is preserved amongst the Orissan atharvavedis, and a few ritually critical mantras AV-P mantras with svaras, especially in the context of the tantric rituals of kubjikA upaniShad (relating to atharvaNa bhadrakAli and bagalamukhI) are known to some of the surviving atharvavedis (but largely kept secret).</description>
